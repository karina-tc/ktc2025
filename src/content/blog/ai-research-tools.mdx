## Synthetics

I used to be an art history nerd. I legit loved reading published papers on the meaning of art and the lives of artists. For me, it was like getting the gossip and juicy details that made up the psyche of an artist.

Categorical research is no different. I find myself at home when I read papers that help me get into the mindset of the problem space and the people I am trying to serve.

However, this is mostly synthetic knowledge. Nothing beats actually talking to people. Just like nothing beats actually seeing an art piece in the wild and not just as a book image. Live work is better in full technicolor than 6 inches of cmyk assumption. 

Buuuut, sometimes, you cannot fly to The Louvre. Just like sometimes, you cannot talk to the people you need to understand. Or maybe you just dont fully have all the information you need to start building an opinion or make assumptions.

For those times, I use a few tools to help me get a lay of the land.
