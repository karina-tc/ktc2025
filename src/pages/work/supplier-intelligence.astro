      Tropic’s Price Benchmarks help customers save money in negotiations, but
      accessing them was cumbersome. The process required multiple steps and
      delivered only partial insights—a legacy of the platform’s
      service-oriented origins.

    kicker="Procurement 101"
    title="How Procurement Teams Use Benchmarks to Negotiate Prices"
  >
    <p>
      For procurement teams, <strong>data is leverage</strong>. When negotiating
      software pricing, they rely on benchmarks to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Validate Pricing</strong> → Is this offer competitive, or are we
        overpaying?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strengthen Negotiation Power</strong> → Benchmark data gives teams
        an evidence-based position to push for better deals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Identify Savings Opportunities</strong> → By comparing proposals
        against industry norms, teams can spot where they should be asking for discounts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Justify Decisions Internally</strong> → Procurement teams often need
        to report back to finance and leadership. Having data-backed insights makes
        it easier to advocate for the right pricing strategy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, benchmarks only work if they are <strong
        >accessible, clear, and directly comparable</strong
      > to a company’s unique contract or proposal. That’s why making <strong
        >Price Benchmarks easier to access and interpret</strong
      > was crucial to this redesign.
    </p>
  </Work.StorySection>

  <!-- Problem -->
  <Work.StorySection kicker="Problem" title="Barriers to Effective Negotiation">
    <p>
      Through usability research and customer interviews, we identified three
      key challenges:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Slow Access to Insights</strong>: Users had to navigate lengthy
        forms just to see basic analytics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lack of Context</strong>: Data wasn't clearly tied to contracts
        or proposals, making it hard to interpret.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Limited Sharing & Portability</strong>: Price Benchmarks weren't
        easily shareable across negotiation teams.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>SHOW PREVIOUS VERSIONS HERE</p>
    <p>
      o address these pain points, I focused on ensuring insights could be
      revisited and shared. Negotiation is a team sport, so I helped establish a
      system to embed Price Benchmarks across the platform, ensuring data was
      portable and accessible at the right time.

  <!-- Research -->
  <Work.StorySection
    kicker="Research"
    title="What Matters in a Price Negotiation?"
  >
    <p>
      To improve the experience, we conducted <strong>customer interviews and internal stakeholder research</strong>. One key insight stood out: <strong>customers often verify pricing by reaching out to their network</strong>. This led to a core idea—<strong>Tropic should feel like an all-knowing friend who can provide benchmark insights effortlessly</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to qualitative research, we analyzed how much data we had and
      what structure we needed to make it actionable.

  <!-- Design -->
  <Work.StorySection kicker="Solution" title="A New Price Benchmark Experience">
    <p>We redesigned Price Benchmarks with three guiding principles:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Speed to Insight</strong>: Removed unnecessary steps and
        automatically pulled data from a customer's most recent contract.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Clarity & Comparability</strong>: Clearly showed where customers
        stood in relation to similar contracts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Portability</strong>: Enabled embedding Price Benchmarks across
        the platform, making insights easily shareable.

  <!-- Usability Changes -->
  <Work.StorySection
    kicker="Usability Changes"
    title="Getting to the Right Place"
  >
    <p>
      With a <strong>tight deadline</strong>, we moved fast. While we tested as
      thoroughly as possible, the real test came when customers interacted with
      a working version in code. Once we reached that stage, we uncovered a few key issues:
    </p>
    <p>
      First, <strong>initial analytics lacked clarity</strong>—customers weren't used to seeing benchmark results immediately, so they didn't immediately recognize the value. Second, <strong>the form was getting lost</strong>—in our effort to create a simple, first-class analytics tool, we unintentionally buried the form inputs, making it hard for users to input their own data.
    </p>
    <h3>The Fix</h3>
    <p>
      To solve these issues, we <strong>made the form more prominent</strong> to ensure users knew where to input their data. We also <strong>added more context to the analytics</strong> by showing empty state messaging when there was no user context, and clear recommendations when we had enough data to make a suggestion.

  <!-- The Impact -->
  <Work.StorySection kicker="Impact" title="Accelerating Negotiations">
    <p>
      Redesigning Tropic’s Price Benchmarks wasn’t just about improving
      usability—it was about making negotiation data more actionable and
      accessible. By streamlining access, improving clarity, and enabling better
      data-sharing, we helped procurement teams negotiate with more confidence
      and efficiency.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Faster access to insights</strong> → Eliminated unnecessary steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Increased engagement</strong> → Users interacted with benchmarks
        more frequently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved decision-making</strong> → Procurement teams could justify
        negotiations more easily.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What's Next?</h3>
    <p>
      This project was just the beginning. My team has already <strong
        >built on this work to further automate benchmark creation</strong
      >, ensuring procurement teams can access relevant insights at the right
      moment in their workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experience reinforced a key lesson for me: <strong
        >even the best data is only as valuable as its usability</strong
      >. Making insights faster and clearer isn’t just a UX challenge—it’s a
      business-critical one.
