    <!-- Problem -->
    <StorySection kicker="Problem" title="Beyond the Contract Horizon">
      <p>
        Built initially around contracts, Tropic's platform faced a critical
        limitation: <strong
          >suppliers without contracts remained invisible, preventing complete
          spend tracking</strong
        >. Our 2023 customer interviews highlighted this as a major concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impact was significant. Shadow spend became harder to track, and <strong
          >customers resorted to using spreadsheets instead of our platform</strong
        >. We needed to reimagine our approach by making suppliers, not
        contracts, the central focus of our platform—creating what we called the
        "supplierverse."
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A great solution would increase customers...</strong>

      <p>
        To make our experience a supplier centric one, I looked at all the data
        objects that made up a supplier so that we could built that universe.
        Through conversations with our Account Executives about customer
        onboarding, we studied how both clients and our team set up Tropic
        accounts. A clear pattern emerged: the <strong
          >key components of a supplier existed in isolation</strong
        >—like separate moons orbiting without any connection to each other.

        With supplier data scattered across our procurement universe, we needed

        Data cleanup may not sound exciting—I'll admin that it's about as
        thrilling as organizing your sock drawer—but it was crucial.
        <strong
          >We needed to Marie Kondo our experience into a crystal-clear supplier
          system that would truly spark joy for our customers.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We needed to organize our data to make it crystal clear how suppliers
        entered our system, while highlighting Tropic's advantages over a basic
        spreadsheet. This approach would provide the comprehensive financial
        reporting our customers needed and help them avoid drifting back into
        XLS space dust.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help me define the borders for our initial exploration, I prioritized
        the initiatives that could help us maximize financial reporting and
        operational value.

      <h3>Polishing Data Clusters</h3>
      <p>
        To build the supplierverse, we needed to optimize several key areas
        within Tropic. We approached this by identifying distinct <strong>data 
        clusters that required improvement before unifying them</strong> into
        a single, cohesive interface.

      <h3>Data Integrations</h3>
      <p>
        We began with the foundation: data integrations, which are the primary
        source of supplier information in Tropic. We re-architected our
        integrations pages to answer four key questions:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>What data can I bring into Tropic?</li>
        <li>How can I ensure my data is as accurate as possible?</li>
        <li>How can I monitor the status of my data?</li>
        <li>How can I trace the origin of my supplier data?</li>
