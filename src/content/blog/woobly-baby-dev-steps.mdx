## Coding in a Flash

It’s wild to think it’s been over a decade since I first touched any code. My very first website? Built in Flash. Why? Because the idea of mastering HTML and CSS felt like climbing Everest with no oxygen. And I was out of shape. Flash, on the other hand, felt intuitive—like designing in Photoshop, just with some extra effects and whistles.

I adored Flash. It was my playground. A space to sneak in Easter eggs and cook up silly animations. But, like all good things in tech, Flash didn’t last-lost to the winds of progress.

My next website was a necessity. A friend pitched me as a “web developer” (spoiler: I wasn’t one). So I cobbled together my first HTML and CSS site under the sheer pressure of not getting found out. It worked, but the imposter syndrome? Immense. It didn’t help that my mom then also sold me out to her boss. I wanted a time out.

Then came emails. Coding emails felt like the universe saying, “you want something easy, try me!”

Lies universe! Lies.

Tables were my nemesis. They were strict. You were limited. Email development taught me patience, discipline, and the art of debugging through sheer trial and error.

It wasn’t glamorous, but it was foundational to my knowledge.

## Ruby Slippers
Fast forward to now, and I’m pushing code into a Ruby on Rails production repo. Ten years ago, I wouldn’t have even believed this was in my orbit. Much less fucking know what Ruby on Rails was.

And honestly? I’m still not great at it. I consider myself a shit engineer. But I’ve come to see that being bad at something isn’t a failure—it’s a gift.

Like getting socks when you’re older. You actually appreciate them more.

So am I great now? LOL! Nah. But being shitty is where the magic happens. It’s what keeps me curious, keeps me learning, and—most importantly—makes me happy.

That’s right, gentle reader. Now coding gives me life. In a way, coding has brought me full circle into what I always felt while making art. The joy of coding is all about pushing happy little bug fixes one at a time.
