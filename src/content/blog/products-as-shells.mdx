Most software products don’t win on interface or features alone. Let’s be honest. Look deep into yourself. You and I both know that most products in the same category do the same things. 

What truly sets a product apart is how it surfaces and transforms the data customers put into it. How it might be able to telepath into a customer's brain and understand what they want before they even know it.

### Hollow Spaces

Before onboarding, every product is just a hollow framework filled with possibilities, but ultimately empty. The real magic happens when a product doesn’t just collect data but turns it into something meaningful—insights that would otherwise take significant time and effort to uncover.

Take an email service provider (ESP) tailored for eCommerce. The core function is simple: send emails, make money. Your customers grant you access to their store and customer base, and in return, you automate outreach. But there are hundreds of ESPs that do exactly that. Worse, brands can now achieve the same result without even buying a dedicated product.

### Data as a Service

So how does an ESP stand out? By making the data work for the customer in unexpected ways. 

Instead of just sending emails, it should reveal why customers engage, which products they’re drawn to (or ignore), how often they return, and, crucially, why they leave. A great ESP doesn’t just facilitate emails—it uncovers behavioral trends, pinpoints opportunities, and helps brands avoid costly mistakes.

Now, how might an ESP truly innovate? One example is smart customer segmentation. Knowing your customers is everything when it comes to building a brand and maintaining a healthy business. 

If an ESP can provide clarity on customer behaviors—not just to optimize campaigns but to help brands invest in their most valuable customers—that’s a game changer. No more losing customers that don't return. No more wasting money on marketing to the wrong people. But instead, making and retaining the right customers.

### Mining Gold

The data customers give you is gold. Not the ability to do something in a UI. But the ability you give them to understand something that was previously buried in raw data. The best products don’t just store and process information. They manifest it in ways that make customers more effective at what they do. The real innovation lies in making data work for the customer in ways that are unexpected and deeply aligned with their goals.
