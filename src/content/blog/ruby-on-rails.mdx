These are my personal notes as I am learning Ruby on Rails. I see these as breadcrumbs that anyone can use to learn. Leave no crumbs — or whatever the kids say now…

&nbsp;

## Conventions

### Ruby is Opinionated
Rails has strong opinions. Its like a wise friend who knows-it-all without the annoying personality. So you need to follow its rules about folder structure and naming conventions to make your life so much easier.

### View Templates
The ERB `(.html.erb)` file can serve a page or a component - this renders the structure. Using ERB `(.html.erb)`, you can interweave Ruby code into your HTML to generate dynamic content.

Structure: Use .html.erb files to define the skeleton of your page.

Functionality: Share responsibilities between .rb files (server-side logic) and Stimulus controllers (front-end interactivity).

Neat tip - you can do really cool shit between tailwind css and dynamic printing to reduce the amount of code.

```erb
<ul class="my-10 space-y-2 [&>li]:font-bold [&>li]:text-base">
  <% @items.each do |item| %>
    <li><%= item.name %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

OR

<ul class="my-10 space-y-2">
  <% @items.each do |item| %>
    <li class="font-bold text-base"><%= item.name %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

### Hacky Style Definitions
In some of my work, I’ve used an .rb file to also define the classes of a component. This allows me to keep the classes organized and outside of the .html.erb — which is specially useful when you want to use the power of css to help you build fuctionality with minimal js.

## Grab a Helper
Rails provides several built-in helpers to simplify front-end tasks.

### Form helpers

The form_with helper ties your form directly to your model, so all you need to worry about is what fields you want.

```erb
<%= form_with(model: @post, local: true) do |form| %>
  <%= form.text_field :title %>
  <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
```



### Link helpers

Forget writing raw link tags. Rails’ link_to helper makes links intuitive and clean:

```erb
<%= link_to "Home", root_path, class: "btn btn-primary" %>
```



### Tag helpers

Tag helpers let you generate HTML programmatically. If you hate cluttered templates, these are your best friend:

```erb
<%= tag.div("Hello, world!", class: "greeting") %>
```

You can tag just about anything, including images. Rails’ image_tag helper is a quick way to add images to your views with all the necessary attributes in place:

```erb
<%= image_tag("logo.png", alt: "Logo", class: "img-fluid") %>
```

## Partials for the Win

Partials are like the Tupperware of Rails—just slightly less colored by your last pasta dish. These are perfect for stashing reusable pieces of view code.

Need a header on every page? A card component? A shared form? Wrap it up in a partial.

To create one, start by naming the file with a leading underscore (e.g., _header.html.erb). Then call it in your views:

```erb
<%= render "header" %>
```

Partials can also take local variables, making them flexible and dynamic:

```erb
<%= render "card", title: "My Title", content: "My Content" %>
```

And in _card.html.erb:

```ruby
<div class="card">
  <h2><%= title %></h2>
  <p><%= content %></p>
</div>
```

It’s like modular design for your templates—clean, efficient, and kind of satisfying.

## Stimulate It

Rails uses StimulusJS for interactive front-end behavior.

Define Your Controller: Create a Stimulus controller in app/javascript/controllers/:

```ruby
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus";

export default class extends Controller {
  static values = { name: String };

  connect() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.nameValue}!`);
  }
}
```



Hook It Up: Attach your controller to HTML elements with data-controller attributes:

```ruby
<div data-controller="example" data-example-name-value="Rails"></div>
```



Enjoy the Magic: Open your browser console and see your Stimulus controller in action.

Stimulus keeps your front-end JavaScript snappy without dragging in an entire framework. It’s a win-win.



## Separation of Concerns

Most devs I’ve worked with have this thing about keeping everything in its lane. I’ve learned that this is for good reason. When you respect separation of concerns, your app or site stays clean and manageable.

### Keep Views Clean:

No one likes messy .html.erb files. Extract logic into helpers or partials.

### Use Helpers:

Got repetitive view logic? Helpers in app/helpers/ are your shortcut to sanity.

### Leverage StimulusJS:

Let Stimulus handle interactivity instead of cramming JavaScript directly into your views.

### Follow MVC Principles:

Stick to the Model-View-Controller pattern for structure that scales.

## Building Pieces

### Routes
Routes in Rails map URLs to controller actions. Add them in `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Basic route
  get '/posts', to: 'posts#index'
  
  # RESTful resource routes
  resources :posts
  
  # Nested routes
  resources :posts do
    resources :comments
  end
  
  # Custom route with params
  get '/posts/:status', to: 'posts#filter'
end
```

### Controllers
Controllers handle incoming requests. Create them using the generator or manually in `app/controllers/`:

```ruby
# Generate via CLI
rails generate controller Posts index show

# Or create manually in app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end
  
  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  end
  
  def create
    @post = Post.new(post_params)
    
    if @post.save
      redirect_to @post, notice: 'Post created!'
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
  
  private
  
  def post_params
    params.require(:post).permit(:title, :content)
  end
end
```

### Models
Models handle data and business logic. Generate them or create manually in `app/models/`:

```ruby
# Generate via CLI
rails generate model Post title:string content:text published:boolean

# Or create manually in app/models/post.rb
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  # Validations
  validates :title, presence: true
  validates :content, length: { minimum: 10 }
  
  # Associations
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :comments
  
  # Scopes
  scope :published, -> { where(published: true) }
  scope :recent, -> { order(created_at: :desc) }
  
  # Custom methods
  def summary
    content.truncate(100)
  end
end
```

### Views
Views render the UI. Create them in `app/views/` using ERB templates:

```erb
<!-- app/views/posts/index.html.erb -->
<div class="posts-container">
  <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
  
  <%= render "shared/flash" %>
  
  <div class="posts-grid">
    <% @posts.each do |post| %>
      <%= render "post", post: post %>
    </div>
  <% end %>
</div>

<!-- app/views/posts/_post.html.erb (partial) -->
<article class="post-card">
  <h2><%= post.title %></h2>
  <p><%= post.summary %></p>
  <%= link_to "Read more", post_path(post), class: "btn btn-primary" %>
</article>
```

### Putting It All Together
A typical workflow for adding a new feature:

1. Add routes in `config/routes.rb`
2. Generate or create the controller
3. Create the model with migrations
4. Add views and partials
5. Test the feature end-to-end

Remember to run migrations after model changes:
```ruby
rails db:migrate
```

And check routes with:
```ruby
rails routes
```
