    <h2>My Human Side</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I like to watch dark psychological thrillers. Watch
      soccer games and baking shows. I enjoy time away from my keyboard by
      playing with my kid and talking walks with my dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      I live in the East Coast of the USA with my wife and its <WeatherPill /> where we are. 
      I am happy to enjoy the every day. While working very hard for my family.
