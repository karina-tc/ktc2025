## Synthetics

I used to be an art history nerd. I legit loved reading published papers on the meaning of art and the lives of artists. For me, it was like getting the gossip and juicy details that made up the psyche of an artist.

Categorical research is no different. I find myself at home when I read papers that help me get into the mindset of the problem space and the people I am trying to serve.

However, this is mostly synthetic knowledge. Nothing beats actually talking to people. Just like nothing beats actually seeing an art piece in the wild and not just as a book image. Live work is better in full technicolor than 6 inches of cmyk assumption. 

Buuuut, sometimes, you cannot fly to The Louvre. Just like sometimes, you cannot talk to the people you need to understand. Or maybe you just don't fully have all the information you need to start building an opinion or make assumptions.

For those times, I use a few tools to help me get a lay of the land.

## Toolbox

  rows={[
    {
      tool: {
        name: "Elicit",
        url: "https://elicit.com/"
      },
      description: "This tool finds and summarizes academic papers around a specific topic. I use it to get more information around a problem space. Often, a lot of innovation happens in the academic world before it hits the mainstream."
    },
    {
      tool: {
        name: "NotebookLM",
        url: "https://notebooklm.google.com/"
      },
      description: "This tool helps you organize and synthesize information from documents. I tend to feed it any details I find in my research through Elicit as well as any other product documentation. This helps me have all my thoughts in one place. Plus, it can create pretty nice knowledge podcasts that I can listen to keep working as I take a break and walk my dog."
    },

      tool: {
        name: "Claude",
        url: "https://claude.ai/"
      },
      description: "I use Claude for quick prototyping, but mostly as a thought bounce-board. I will keep a design diary there through projects and then feed those again to NotebookLM."
    },
    {
      tool: {
        name: "Perplexity",
        url: "https://www.perplexity.ai/"
      },
      description: "I use Perplexity for quick answers where I don't need to go too deep. I like it as a way to also track things I have previously searched for in a neat way."
