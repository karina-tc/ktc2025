Lately, there’s been a lot of noise about what it means to be a product designer. Layoffs, hiring freezes, teams shrinking.


Some blame AI, saying it’s swallowing up jobs like some kind of mechanical ouroboros. Others point to the flood of bootcamp grads, overwhelming the talent pool like a poorly managed Figma file. And then there’s the quiet whisper—the one that stings a little—that maybe, just maybe, we only have ourselves to blame.

I’ve been a designer for a little over a decade. I’ve been lucky enough to stay employed most of that time. I don’t claim to be the best designer in the world. Hell, _I know I’m not_. But I do know this: This moment calls for something deeper than pointing fingers about the state of the industry.

It calls for reflection—not just on our collective identity as designers, but on who we are as individuals.

And so I’ve been asking myself: _Who am I as a designer? What actually makes me special?_ But here’s the hard truth: None of us are _that_ special.

If you’re good at this job, you should be able to execute well, empathize with customers, think strategically, and communicate clearly. That’s the bare minimum.

So if we’re all working from the same blueprint, what actually sets us apart?

I think the answer lies in two things: **how we operate within the product trifecta** and **who we are outside of design**.

## <span class="block mb-3">🥾</span> The Climb

The trifecta—PM, Design, and Engineering—used to be a sturdy little formation. A well-trodden path. Everyone had their place.

Now? **It’s a rockslide waiting to happen.**

Sometimes a junior PM is paired with a senior designer. Sometimes an engineer takes the lead while the other two play catch-up. Someone always steps up. Someone always becomes the gravitational center of the work.

**The climb isn't clear anymore.** There’s no neat little path. You have to **figure out your own way up**. 

So, what kind of climber are you?

- Are you the one **plotting the route** before taking a step?
- Are you the one **scrambling up on instinct**, figuring it out as you go?
- Or are you the one **tying the ropes**, making sure no one falls?

Beyond that, the best designers I know bring something else to the climb—something beyond their craft. Music, philosophy, industrial design, whatever lens they use to see the world.

Maybe the real differentiator isn’t _what_ we do, but how _you_ navigate the climb.

Lately, I’ve been calling this phase _finding your peak_. Because here’s the thing: peaks are personal.

Some designers chase Everest—big roles, big titles, big paychecks. Others are boulderers, quick and scrappy, solving problems on the fly. Some are trail builders, laying down systems that make the path easier for others.

And then, most of us? Well, we’re just trying not to fall off the goddamn mountain.

No matter what kind of climber you are, one thing is true: you need a strong grip. That’s **what keeps you steady**—the instincts, the experience, the judgment that tells you which hold to trust, when to shift your weight, and when to let go and let others take the lead. This is core to the work.

Then there are your ropes—the tools you rely on when the climb gets tough. In other words, how you keep yourself and others from falling.

And how you reach your peak—well, that’s what sets you apart. It’s **your perspective**. How you lead, how you see the landscape, how you shape the climb in your own way.


### Climbing Toward Your Peak

Not every climber takes the same approach. Some of us lean more into one strength than another—but the best product people know how to **own more than one role when the moment calls for it**.

They way I see it, there are three types of product people:

- **The Route Setter**<br />The one who maps the climb, picks the best path, and ensures the route actually makes sense.
- **The Summit Seeker**<br />The one who questions the path, sees beyond the obvious, and asks if we should be climbing a different mountain altogether.
- **The Rope Technician**<br />The one who tightens the safety lines, trims unnecessary weight, and makes sure the climb is smooth, secure, and actually enjoyable.

Most product folks can be any of these. These styles aren’t unique to design, but **designers have the rare ability to be all three at once**.

Some climbs require strategy. Some require intuition. Some require clean execution. But your peak is yours alone.

Finding it isn’t just about choosing a role—it’s about knowing which strengths to rely on when the climb demands it.

## <span class="block mb-3">⛰️</span> Reaching Summit

I’ve always been obsessed with breaking through the mundane—giving people experiences that make them stop, notice, and feel something different.

Back when I made art, that meant turning everyday moments into something unexpected—dancing with friends on subway cars, building pieces that connected human to human in ways they weren’t expecting.

Now, as a designer, that same philosophy drives me.

At the core of it, I give a shit about people.

I care about making sure that what I put into the world makes them feel better—about themselves, their work, and how they move through their day. I care about software being more than just a tool. It should empower people, elevate them, even help them get promoted.

That’s why **my peak is being the Summit Seeker**. I don’t just climb to reach the top.

I look beyond the peak in front of me. I scan the surrounding mountains, thinking, _how do I make this my best summit yet?_ Because reaching the top isn’t the goal. What you do once you’re there is.

Some peaks are just resting points. Some reveal new paths you couldn’t see from below. And sometimes, when you get high enough, you realize there’s an even better mountain waiting to be climbed. Granted, this is as much as I know about climbing as I myself am an indoor cat. Thanks Discovery Channel.

Now you should know that finding **your peak isn’t about planting a flag and making sure everyone sees it**.

The danger here is focusing too much on what makes you special and slipping into the mindset of making sure everyone knows it.

Finding your peak isn’t about turning yourself into a personal brand. It’s not about curating a feed of hot takes or making sure your name is attached to every shiny project.

**Your peak should help you lead with influence, not become an influencer.**

True influence isn’t about visibility. It’s about _impact_. It’s about showing up in a way that makes the work better, the team stronger, the product more thoughtful.

Because the best climbers? They don’t waste time shouting from the summit.

They’re already looking for the next mountain.
