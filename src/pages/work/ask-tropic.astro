    <p>
      In a little over a month, we designed and developed Tropic's Ask AI
      feature—a chat interface that helps customers quickly find information.
      This feature uses multiple specialized AI agents to assist customers with
      tasks like creating requests, analyzing account data, and reviewing
      procurement policies against contracts and requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >I led the creation of a foundational system that other teams could use
        to help users interact with their agents</strong
      >, while also designing the core Ask AI experience. To create this Ask AI
      system, I focused on the following:

  <!-- Development -->
  <Work.StorySection kicker="Development" title="Shapping Tropic's Assistant">
    <p>
      <strong
        >I was also lucky to be given the opportunity to play with code and so I
        contributed to the front-end development</strong
      >, working alongside another developer who handled back-end integration
      and optimization.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the span of two weeks, we developed a code prototype that allowed our
      team to test and refine the intended user experience. This <strong
        >hands-on approach helped us evaluate performance requirements and
        optimize the build</strong
      >. While we started with design mockups, much of the real design work
      happened directly in code—enabling me to fine-tune the UI and create a
      polished, distinctive experience within our application.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my favorite aspects of this project was enhancing the UI with
      subtle interactions that gave it a more polished, established feel to
      hopefully spark some joy in our customers' experience.

  <!-- Reception -->
  <Work.StorySection kicker="Reception" title="Making it Beta">
    <p>
      This feature has just been released and is in beta—we're using this period
      to fine-tune our agents and optimize experiences that required more
      development time. As Tropic's biggest user of our own platform for spend
      management, we're thoroughly dogfooding this feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initial feedback has been overwhelmingly positive from both Tropic and
      customers. We've received an exceptional amount of customer feedback on
      this feature—a strong signal of successful adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there are some expected rough edges, that's exactly what beta
      testing and dogfooding are designed to address. I cannot take credit for
      the mazing work that other teams did on this feature, but I am surely
      proud of the amount of love and care that we put into this experience.
