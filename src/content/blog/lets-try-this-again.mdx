## Its the end of the year
And I am at the end of my rope. This whole year I’ve redesigned my personal site in Figma more than I’d like to disclose. Always unhappy with the end results. I even have 3 dead repos at this point. They all have those now defunct pixels from versions past.

I’ve struggled quite a bit with what I want this site to be. A site for me, that I will love. That I might turn into my personal OS… or a site for you, dearest reader. The thing is that I don’t know who you are. You might be a recruiter. You might be a coworker. You might be a stalker. The world at large says that we, designers, should have magnificent sites. They should have bells and whistles. They should have it all.

The struggle was too much. Plus, I wanted to enjoy my eggnog with rum without having to think of components and APIs.

## Kiss and makeup
I couldn’t take the stress of this relationship.

Designing for everyone and everything. It made life very stressful. Many sleepless nights were spend. I even had one or two night stands with strange Framer templates. These left me unsatisfied. They made me feel so bad. I know how to code… I think… How dare I use a template!?

So I just ended up narrowing down things to its simplest form. Trying to act like a good PM, I gave me requirements. I gave me a deadline. What can I code in a week? How can I describe me in a week.

What you see as a simple site now, was not so simple to start. But, I was reminded of the beauty behind KISS and why it so true. For now, I am happy with this site. Sure, one day. Maybe. I will also know how to use Spline and shaders and all these things. Today, that is not the day. Today is a day where we just let it go and marvel at how good simple design — and code — can make a girl feel.
