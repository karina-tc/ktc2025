      <p>
        Built initially around contracts, Tropic's platform faced a critical
        limitation: <strong
          >suppliers without contracts remained invisible, preventing complete
          spend tracking</strong
        >. Our 2023 customer interviews highlighted this as a major concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impact was significant. Shadow spend became harder to track, and <strong
          >customers resorted to using spreadsheets instead of our platform</strong

        To make our experience a supplier centric one, I looked at all the data
        objects that made up a supplier so that we could built that universe.
        Through conversations with our Account Executives about customer
        onboarding, we studied how both clients and our team set up Tropic
        accounts. A clear pattern emerged: the <strong
          >key components of a supplier existed in isolation</strong

        Data cleanup may not sound exciting—I'll admin that it's about as

        We needed to organize our data to make it crystal clear how suppliers
        entered our system, while highlighting Tropic's advantages over a basic
        spreadsheet. This approach would provide the comprehensive financial
        reporting our customers needed and help them avoid drifting back into
        XLS space dust.

      </p>

      <ol>

        <li>How can I ensure my data is as accurate as possible?</li>

      Onboarding in Tropic can be lengthy since we ensure data accuracy while

      use AI to enhance supplier matching between ERPs and Tropic.

      With improved data connection management, we needed to explore how users
      could see all their data in one clear surface. Over two weeks of
      explorations, we went deep on how the supplierverse could provide value to
      both finance and procurement teams. For this rocket ship to launch
      successfully, we had to make both these personas happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these explorations, I met with the Product and Engineering leads to
      refine our initial designs, focusing on what we knew would succeed. Since
      our team was newly formed, we decided to pursue achievable wins rather
      than moonshot ideas to build credibility with stakeholders and gain
      momentum in our work.

      Throughout our explorations, I focused on showing glimpses of potential
      features. However, I became convinced that data clarity alone wouldn't
      justify our customers' investment in Tropic. What we needed to build—and
      what our design partners were actively seeking—was a way to demonstrate
      how supplier costs affected their bottom line. Enter, the finance super
      galaxy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I'm not a financial scientist myself, I was lucky to partner with a
      Product Lead who had universal knowledge of what finance teams scan for
      when searching for spend signals. Plus, another crew had already done the
      heavy lifting of making it easier for customers to plot their contract
      coordinates and cost trajectories. This alignment of the stars helped us
      launch our Contracts vs Actual mission into orbit.

      Initially, I had proposed adding as much detail as we could to the table.
      This included adding contracts, requests and usage data. However, as the
      work progressed we realized that adding that data into the index might
      cause our application to become very slow. So that soon evolved into a
      data exercise to optimize our data and make our reporting more nimble to
      any filtering changes by our customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We removed this feature from the initial launch due to time constraints.
      This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as I had concerns about how
      our time-sensitive reporting would handle time-bound data. Our final table
      was straightforward yet effective. Soon after launch, we saw Account
      Executives and customers taking action to improve accounts' contract data
      and ensure their integrations were properly connected.
